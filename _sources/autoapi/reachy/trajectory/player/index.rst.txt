.. class:: TrajectoryPlayer(reachy, trajectories, freq=100)


   Bases: :py:obj:`object`

   Trajectory player abstraction.

   :param reachy: robot which will play the trajectory
   :type reachy: :py:class:`~reachy.Reachy`
   :param trajectories: Trajectory to play (such as {motor_name: list of positions})
   :type trajectories: dict
   :param freq: Replay sample frequency (in Hz)
   :type freq: float

   Provides high-level features to:
       * play a pre-defined trajectory
       * wait for the end of the replay
       * add fade in to smooth begining of motion

   .. method:: play(self, wait=False, fade_in_duration=0)

      Play a given trajectory.

      :param wait: whether or not to wait for the end of the trajectory replay
      :type wait: bool
      :param fade_in_duration: time in seconds to reach the starting position (can be used to smooth the begining of the motion)
      :type fade_in_duration: float

      .. warning:: you can call play multiple times to replay the trajectory. You are responisble for handling the concurrency issue if you try to run multiple trajectories on the same motors.


   .. method:: wait_for_end(self)

      Block until the end of a trajectory replay.


   .. method:: _play_loop(self)
